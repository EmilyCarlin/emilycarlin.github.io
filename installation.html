          <h3> A bit of background</h3>
          <p> <a href="https://www.appcues.com/" target="_blank">Appcues</a> is a tool that allows people to build
            onboarding, feature announcements, surveys,
            and other experiences on top of their product without writing any code.</p>
          <p> In order to publish the content they build with Appcues to their end uers, our customers need to install
            Appcues. Installing is a prerequisite for making the most of Appcues, but our instructions were causing a
            lot of confusion and unhappiness for our
            customers, not to mention our own customer success and support teams.</p>

          <h3> The story of building a better experience</h3>
          <p> I worked with a wonderful team of four engineers on a project to overhaul the Appcues installation
            experience. I led the effort from research to design to release.</p>
          <p>The result of our efforts is <a href="https://studio.appcues.com/settings/installation" target="_blank">live</a>,
            but
            does require a (free!) Appcues account to access.</p>

          <h3> Understand the problem </h3>
          <p> I began by talking to people. How did the internal teams who work with customers every day think about
            the problem? In sessions with customer success, support, sales, and marketing folks, I began to uncover
            a map of the journey towards installation.</p>
          <p> I also surveyed internal systems. I searched our support software and product feedback trackers for
            anything related to "installation." I also watched <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank">FullStory</a>
            sessions of folks using the existing installation tool.</p>

          <p class="space-above"> Journey maps are a great way to build shared understanding
            and make sure folks
            are aligned on what exactly the problem is that we are solving for.</p>
