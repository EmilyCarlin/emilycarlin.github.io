        <h3>a bit of background</h3>
        <p> <a href="https://www.appcues.com/" target="_blank">Appcues</a> is a tool for building
          onboarding, feature announcements, surveys,
          and other experiences right on top of a product without writing any code.</p>
        <p> In order to publish the content they build to their end uers, our customers need to <span style="font-weight:900">install
            Appcues.</span>
          Installing is a prerequisite for making the most of Appcues, but our instructions were causing a
          lot of confusion and unhappiness for our
          customers, not to mention our own customer success and support teams.</p>

        <h3> the story of building a better experience</h3>
        <p> I worked with a wonderful team of four engineers on a project to overhaul the Appcues installation
          experience. I led the effort from research to design to release.</p>
        <p>The result of our efforts is <a href="https://studio.appcues.com/settings/installation" target="_blank">live</a>,
          but
          does require a (free!) Appcues account to access.</p>

        <h3> understand the problem </h3>
        <p> I began by talking to people. How do the internal teams who work with customers every day think about
          the problem? In sessions with customer success, support, sales, and marketing folks, I began to map out
          the customer's journey to installation. </p>
        <p> I also gathered and analyzed as much user data as I could find: I conducted exploratory user research,
          searched our support software and
          product feedback trackers for
          anything installation related, and watched <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank">FullStory</a>
          sessions of folks using the existing installation feature.</p>

        <h3> refine the understanding </h3>
        <p>Next, I documented what I learned in exploratory and generative research. For this project, which spans
          many
          different types of users and unfolds
          over a variable length of time, journey maps and service blueprints ended up working well; I shared them
          with
          teammates to get feedback and build shared understanding.</p>

        <h3> sketching towards a solution </h3>
        <p> Once I had a sense of the problem space, I started to map out re-imagined user flows and
          sketch out rough examples of forms the interface could take. This is the part of the process I tend to
          spend
          the most time on; taking time to think in a divergent and generative way pays major dividends
          later in the project. </p>

        <h3> testing concepts </h3>
        <p> At this point, it was time to evaluate our most promising concepts with users. We conducted a few rounds
          of tests with users. </p>

        <h3> converging </h3>
        <p> After many rounds of iteration + testing, we eventually decided on a direction that seemed reasonably
          simple for our team to build and for our customers to use. We created a path for our non-technical users to
          understand their role in getting Appcues installed, and also created a step-by-step guide that speaks to
          developers in terms they're used to, and provides rationale for each step in the process. </p>

        <p> The iteration was not over yet (is it ever, really?) -- once we decided on a direction, it was time to
          hammer out all of the visual and interaction details. This was made much easier by our team's design
          system;
          which exists in Figma and in React. </p>

        <p> Early indicators look good: anecdotal evidence from internal teams and customer conversations suggest the
          streamlined installation experience makes it easier to get installed quickly + successfully.</p>
        <p>During the earlier stages of the project, we defined a set of success metrics and added the necessary
          product instrumentation to track progress over time. This will help us continue to
          enhance the experience + make the complex process of installation as simple and pleasant as possible. </p>
