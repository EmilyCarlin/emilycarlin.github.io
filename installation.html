        <h3>a bit of background</h3>
        <p> <a href="https://www.appcues.com/" target="_blank">Appcues</a> is a tool for building
          onboarding, feature announcements, surveys,
          and other experiences right on top of your product without writing any code.</p>
        <p> In order to publish the content they build to their end uers, our customers need to <span style="font-weight:900">install
            Appcues.</span>
          Installing is a prerequisite for making the most of Appcues, but our instructions were causing a
          lot of confusion and unhappiness for our
          customers, not to mention our own customer success and support teams.</p>

        <h3> the story of building a better experience</h3>
        <p> I worked with a wonderful team of four engineers on a project to overhaul the Appcues installation
          experience. I led the effort from research to design to release.</p>
        <p>The result of our efforts is <a href="https://studio.appcues.com/settings/installation" target="_blank">live</a>,
          but
          does require a (free!) Appcues account to access.</p>

        <h3> understand the problem </h3>
        <p> I began by talking to people. How do the internal teams who work with customers every day think about
          the problem? In sessions with customer success, support, sales, and marketing folks, I began to uncover
          a map of the journey towards installation.</p>
        <p> I also surveyed internal systems. I searched our support software and product feedback trackers for
          anything related to "installation." I also watched <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank">FullStory</a>
          sessions of folks using the existing installation tool.</p>

        <h3> refine the understanding </h3>
        <p> After initial exploratory and generative research, I communicated my understanding of
          the problem space to my teammates. For this project, which spans many different types of users and unfolds
          over a variable length of time, journey maps and service blueprints ended up working well to build shared
          understanding among the team.</p>
