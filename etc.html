      <h2> Recent Case Studies - Work in Progress </h2>
      <p> Over the past year or so I've had the chance to work with various Fortune 500 clients. Full case studies for each project are forthcoming, below is a summary of each project I've had the opportunity to work on. </p>
      <h1 class="etc-case-studies"> Web App Design // Internet of Things </h1>
      <p> I worked with a team of two designers, two front-end developers, and product owners and stakeholders to build an application for reviewing, entering, managing data from a network of connected devices.</p>
      <p> I developed the information architecture for the system, designed mid-fidelity prototypes to test and validate product vision, and collaborated with front-end developers on creating a component framework for future development. </p>
      <h1 class="etc-case-studies"> Mobile App Design + Journey Mapping // Automotive Industry </h1>
      <p> I worked with one other designer on a future-looking, exploratory product to support an automotive company on a platform for autonomous vehicles. This work is under an NDA. </p>
      <h1 class="etc-case-studies">  Web App Design // Financial Services </h1>
      <p> I led design for an internal tool for a large bank. I led design from user research, journey mapping and information architecture, all the way to high-fidelity screens to supporting developers in actually building the thing. The project is still under development. </p>
      <h1 class="etc-case-studies">  Web and Mobile App Design // Financial Services </h1>
      <p> The project I am working on currently is a customer-facing app for a large bank. Design covers a web application and native mobile applications. Design activites include user research, wireframing, prototyping, visual design, design system creation and management, and collaborating with front-end developers on implementation. My team is comprised of product owners, ten developers, and various client stakeholders. </p>
