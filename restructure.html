          <h1 class="section-title"> Background </h1>
          <p> Tamr is a machine learning and data science software startup in Cambridge, MA. Their mision is to remove silos within the enterprise and let companies actually take advantage of "big data." Research shows that data scientists spend 60% of their
            time cleaning and organizing data as opposed to actual analysis. Much of this cleaning and organizing is rote - basically, busy work. Tamr's software uses machine learning to automate this process, which frees up data scientists to spend their
            time driving insights with data. </p>
          <p> Tamr has a team focused on the challenges unique to data preparation and analysis for life sciences companies. I led design on this team, alongside five engineers and three data scientists.</p>

        <div class="study-part">
          <h1 class="section-title"> Role + Contributions </h1>
          <p> Over the course of four months, with support and feedback from other product designers at Tamr, I designed a critical component of Tamr's software; the ability to transform data. This meant I had the chance to:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li> Visit customer sites to conduct contextual inquiry and user interviews </li>
            <li> Collaborate with product managers to define end-to-end concept and overall visions
              <li> Prototype + iterate on approaches </li>
              <li> Create high-fidelity mockups </li>
              <li> Paired development sessions with engineers </li>
              <li> Contribute HTML/CSS code for look and feel </li>
          </ul>

          <h1 class="section-title"> 01. The Challenge </h1>
          <p> Imagine a researcher at a life sciences company that is evaluating a new treatment. </p>
          <div class="drawing">
            <img src="assets/listen.png">
          </div>
          <p> Patients come in and the researcher notes down their information on a physical form. </p>
          <div class="drawing">
            <img src="assets/write.png">
          </div>
          <p> Once the session concludes, the researcher will enter the results into a data table - one row per patient.
            <p>
              <div class="drawing">
                <img src="assets/entry.png">
              </div>
              <p> The problem is that for analysis, the one row per patient format isn't right. For data collection, they want one patient per row. But for data analysis, they want to move the information stored in columns to information stored in rows.  </p>
              <div class="drawing">
                <img src="assets/table1.png">
                <img src="assets/table2.png">
              </div>
              <p> In other words, they need a way to restructure the data. This particular transformation is called an "unpivot." We began by targeting this data transformation because, based on user interviews and obersvation, it was causing the most time wasted and frustration among people using the Tamr software. We knew we would build in more transformations, though, so the design would need to be flexible and modular; basically, our goal was to define a framework for future data transformation capabilities.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="study-part">
              <h1 class="section-title"> 02. The Process</h1>
              <h2 class="subsection-title"> Research </h2>
              <p> I started with questions: What is the larger context that data scientists work in at life sciences companies? What are their goals? What are there challenges? Many of our clients were already using the Tamr software to transform their data - what did they like about the experience? What frustrated them? </p>
              <div class="drawing">
                <img src="assets/questions.png">
              </div>
              <p> Then I looked for the answers: I interviewed internal data scientists, I visited some of our life sciences clients to observe their data scientists at work, and I did a competitive analysis of other data transformation tools. </p>
              <p> Next, I shared what I found with my project team. Using our research findings, a product manager and I worked to define our longer-term end-to-end vision so the team would share a common language and set of goals for our day-to-day work. </p>
