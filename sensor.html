        <h3> background </h3>
        <p> Sump pumps are unglamorous but critical devices that prevent basements from flooding. Since they are
          electrical/mechanical devices, they can fail. </p>
        <p>Boulder Automation's SumpSense is an integrated hardware/software solution that
          alerts users of any issues with their sump pump. It's like a <a class="light" href="https://nest.com/smoke-co-alarm/overview/"
            target="_blank"> Nest smoke alarm</a>, but instead of smoke
          it detects sump pump failures. I am designing the SumpSense mobile application
          (currently
          in iOS private beta).</p>

          <h3> my role </h3>
          <p> In addition to designing the mobile application that accompanies the sump pump sensor, I've also been a
            bit of a deisgn jack of all trades on the project; from designing the logo and brand to creating pitch
            decks.</p>

        <h3> mapping out a minimum viable product </h3>
        <p> The app + accompanying hardware is under active development; we're focused on a minimum viable product that
          we can get in front of beta users to begin testing + iterating. My first step was to work with my teammates
          to map out the minimum set
          actions the app needs to support.</p>

        <h3> sketching architecture </h3>
        <p> Once the team was aligned on the core user needs that the application would meet, I mapped out a simple
          system architecture of each unique screen in the application. </p>
        <p> We tried to keep it as simple as possible; still working under the hypothesis that if all goes according to
          plan, once a user has paired their unit and configured their notifications, this app should really just
          collect dust in a folder on someone's phone.</p>

        <h3> defining core flows </h3>
        <p> Once we confirmed the main actions the app should support with a few homeowners who met our ideal
          customer profile and the team agreed on a high-level architecture, I moved on to wireframes of the core
          application flows. Shown below (in all
          the messy glory
          of my actual Figma canvas) are the flows for pairing the SumpSense hardware with the mobile application. </p>

          <h3> what's next? iterate, iterate </h3>
          <p> Before I joined the team, the first version of the application was written as a proof-of-concept in
            Objective C. The team is now re-writing the application in React Native. Once
            that initiative
            is
            complete, we will give test units to a set of beta testers and begin the fun part: seeing how the system
            actually works in the wild. </p>
