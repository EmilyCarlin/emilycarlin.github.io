    <h1> PumpSense: Website design and mobile app design  </h1>
    <section class="study-section">
      <p> Boulder Automation is a Coloado based startup that makes a product called "PumpSense." The PumpSense product is a tracking system for sump pumps. If you are not a homeowner with a basement, you may not care much about sump pumps. But if you do have a basement, then you know that sump pumps are what stands between your basement and flooding. The PumpSense product uses sophisticated algorithms to detect problems as well as potential problems with sump pumps. </p>
      <p> I designed the PumpSense website, designed their logo, did their branding, and am in the process of designing their installation experience - which involves elements of hardware as well as software. A full case study of both the website and experience design is in progress. Below are some icons I designed to depict various statistics and notifications that the system can send to users. </p>
