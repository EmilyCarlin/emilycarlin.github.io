    <h1> Hello! </h1>
    <p> I'm Emily Carlin, a born and raised Coloradan/Coloradoan, UX designer, and writer.
      I'm interested in designing experiences that empower people to create and express themselves.
      Right now, I work as a UX designer at Slalom in Boston.
      Before that, I was a UX designer at Tamr, a big data/machine learning startup in Cambridge.
      Outside of design, I like to read, write, play the guitar, and ride my bike. </p>


    <h1> I'm reading...</h1>
    <a href="http://www.nointerface.com/book/"> The Best Interface is No Interface </a> by Golden Krishna. It's kind of a manifesto against "screen-based thinking." I find it inspiring, helpful, and fun to read. A lot of the time good design has nothing to do with a screen (or as Krishna calls them, "lazy rectangles.") It has changed the way I approach new projects, and reminded me that there's a lot more to consider when you think about experience design than "slapping an interface on it."
    <h1> I'm learning...</h1>
    <p> Swift with <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/"> Swift Playgrounds.</a> Although this was technically designed for young people to learn to code, I find it SO fun and immersive.</p>
    <p> I'm also honing my HTML/CSS/Javascript skills with the second-to-none SuperHi program. I built this website you're reading experiencing now with skills I from in SuperHi!</p>
