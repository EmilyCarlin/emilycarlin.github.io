      <h2> a bit about me </h2>
      <p> I'm committed to designing ethical tools that empower people to create, express themselves, and live better.
        I'm also committed to resisting products and services that attempt to exploit people's time, attention, and/or
        money. </p>
      <p>I'm a generalist through and through, and am as comfortable designing research initiatives, laying out
        information architecture, and prototyping as I am creating high-fidelity screens, maintaining design systems,
        fine-tuning microcopy (I &#9829 UX writing),
        and working with developers to bring screens to life. </p>
      <p> I'm interested in promoting access to tech jobs, and to diversity in all forms within the field. To that end,
        I teach aspiring designers at <a href="https://www.startupinstitute.com/boston" target="_blank">Startup
          Institute.</a> In 2018 I was honored with a "best instructor" award. I also
        mentor
        folks through <a href="https://boston.aiga.org/" target="_blank">AIGA Boston </a>and the<a href="https://techjobstour.com/speakers/emily-carlin/">
          Tech Jobs Tour.</a>
      </p>
      <p> Prior to working as a designer, I was a researcher. I worked at MIT with Dr. Sherry Turkle on her NYTimes
        best selling book <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/books/review/jonathan-franzen-reviews-sherry-turkle-reclaiming-conversation.html"
          target="_blank">
          Reclaiming Conversation.</a> I also worked with the Tufts Human Computer Interaction Lab, where I
        published a <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/papers/peck.ieeecomputer.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> on
        designing brain computer interfaces in IEEE Computer. </p>
      <p> Outside of design, I love to ride my bike around Boston, play guitar, lift weights, read books, spend
        time
        outside. </p>
