    <h1> Hello! </h1>
    <p> I'm Emily Carlin. I hail from the great state of Colorado, and now I live in Cambridge, MA. </p> 
      <p> I'm interested in designing experiences that empower people to create and express themselves.
      Right now, I work as a UX designer at Slalom in Boston.
      Before that, I was a UX designer at Tamr, a big data/machine learning startup in Cambridge.</p>
      <p> And before that, I worked as a lead researcher for Dr. Sherry Turkle at MIT. I worked on her critically acclaimed book <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/books/review/jonathan-franzen-reviews-sherry-turkle-reclaiming-conversation.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=2CADC479A4B7C14E3E272B997392D480&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now"> <i> Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age. </i> </a> I also worked in the Tufts Human Computer Interaction Lab, where I focused on the practical use of brain-computer interfaces. I published a paper called <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/papers/peck.ieeecomputer.pdf"> Designing Brain-Computer Interfaces for Attention-Aware Systems</a> in IEEE Computer. </p>
      <p> I write about design on <a href= "https://medium.com/@emilycarlin"> Medium </a> and I teach user experience design classes at <a href= https://www.startupinstitute.com/boston/> The Startup Institute</a> in Boston. In fall of 2017 I was honored with the "student's choice" instructor award. 
      I also mentor folks through <a href="https://lesbianswhotech.org/about/"> Lesbians Who Tech </a> and <a href="https://techjobstour.com/speakers/emily-carlin/"> The Tech Jobs Tour</a>. I'm passionate about making tech more inclusive.</p>
      <p> I love to read, write, play the guitar, walk around town, and ride my bike. </p>


    <h1> I'm reading...</h1>
    <a href="http://www.nointerface.com/book/"> The Best Interface is No Interface </a> by Golden Krishna. It's kind of a manifesto against "screen-based thinking." I find it inspiring, helpful, and fun to read. A lot of the time good design has nothing to do with a screen (or as Krishna calls them, "lazy rectangles.") It has changed the way I approach new projects, and reminded me that there's a lot more to consider when you think about experience design than "slapping an interface on it."
    <h1> I'm learning...</h1>
    <p> Swift with <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/"> Swift Playgrounds.</a> Although this was technically designed for young people to learn to code, I find it SO fun and immersive.</p>
    <p> I'm also honing my HTML/CSS/Javascript skills with the awesome <a href="https://www.superhi.com/"> SuperHi</a> program. I built this very website with SuperHi skills!</p>
    <h1> I'm listening to...</h1>
    <p> This <a href=https://open.spotify.com/album/25X28V6p34T7dNc2x7Vzt4?si=7I61i6x4Tje-icsXF-B9CA> Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, and Linda Rondstadt album.</a> I'm seeing Emmylou Harris play at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival this summer. Pretty psyched. </p>
    <h1> I'm using...</h1>
    <p> This <a href="https://www.are.na/"> tool called Are.na.</a>  It's a bit like Pinterest. I've been using it to collect and connect articles, ideas, <a href="https://www.are.na/emily-carlin/data-table-filtering-ux"> design inspiration </a> and also follow the amazing folks who are part of the community. </p>
