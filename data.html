                <h3> background </h3>
                <p> Tamr is a company dedicated to helping enterprises do more with their data. Through a mix of
                    machine learning and human collaboration, Tamr makes it easy for companies to do the rote data
                    cleanup tasks that don't require much skill but take up a lot of data scientist's time. Tamr's goal
                    is to allow people to spend their time learning from data and acting on it; not finding it and
                    cleaning it
                    up.</p>

                    <h3> my role </h3>
                    <p> I was the lead designer on a multi-disciplinary team of engineers and data scientists at <a
                            class=href="https://www.tamr.com/" target="_blank">Tamr</a>. I regularly
                        collaborated with and got feedback from an incredible team of three other deisgners. Over
                        the
                        course of four
                        months, we built a tool for restructuring data. </p>

                    <img class="no-shadow" src="assets/challenge-1.png">
                    <p>Imagine a researcher at a pharmaceutical company that is evaluating a new
                        treatment.</p>
                    <img class="no-shadow" src="assets/challenge-2.png">
                    <p>Patients come in and the researcher notes down their information.</p>
                    <img class="no-shadow" src="assets/challenge-3.png">
                    <p>The researcher then enters the results into a table that matches the study form where they
                        took their notes - one row per patient.</p>
                </section>
                <p>The problem is that this row by row format is optimized for data collection; not
                    for data
                    analysis. When data is analyzed, it's better in a "tall and skinny" format, with one row per
                    test per patient.</p>
                <p> Our mission was to create a tool that would make it easy for scientists to <span class="bold">restructure
                        their data.</span>The first step was to build the toolkit for humans to do the transformations.
                    The second step was to add in machine learning so that the system could learn what common
                    transformations were and then perform them automatically.</p>

                    <h3> the research </h3>
                    <p> I started with a lot of questions: Who would be using the tool? Where, when, and why would they
                        use it? </p>
                    <p> I sought out the answers through interviews with data scientists, on-site visits to various
                        pharmaceutical companies, and competitive research of tools in the space.</p>
                    <p> Then I shared what I found with my team: I presented findings to my team. Once we had a shared
                        understanding of what we were building and who we were building it for, we moved on to thinking
                        about the tool itself. </p>

                <h3> sketching </h3>
                <p> I spent a lot of time diverging, sketching, and getting my head around the problem. I was lucky
                    enough to work with a big team of data scientists who sketched with me, answered questions, and
                    generally helped me start converging on a vision for how the tool would function.</p>

                <p> After a few rounds of simple Invision prototypes, the team started to build. </p>
                <p> With such a complex operation, it’s hard to really find the holes with the hardcoded experience of
                    an Invision prototype or wireframe walkthrough.</p>
                <p> At this stage, I conducted usability testing and shared results with the rest of the team. This
                    revealed (as it always does) all sorts of nuances that we hadn’t considered. </p>
                <p> The process continued this way — built, test, iterate.</p>

                    <p> The tool was adopted by a range of customers, particularly those at life sciences companies.
                        The tool is now in use at a number of life sciences companies. Users report a significant
                        improvement in efficiency and ease of use compared to other data restructuring options.</p>
